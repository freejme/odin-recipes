     <h3> This is a recipe that I created by modifying my mother's recipe. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur and he scrapes the pan every time! I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health conscious. Enjoy!</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>24oz dry fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>3/4 pint heavy cream</li>
             <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
             <li>1 dash garlic</li>
             <li>3/4 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
             <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
<li>In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.</li>
<li>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.</li>
