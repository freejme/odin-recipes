     <h3> This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

             <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
